    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Like many other recipes, I learned this one from my father. These chili beans are perfect, spicy, tangy, a little sweet and packed full of meat, beans and corn. It's a very simple recipe, we don't have to do much with it, just let it cook on the gas stove.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>50 dkg minced meat (beef, pork or mixed)</li>
        <li>1 liter pureed tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 cans red beans </li>
        <li>1 can corn</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>chili to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onions, then saut√© them in a little oil. When the onion is ready, add the paprika, stir for a minute and let the paprika melt.</li>
        <li>Add the minced meat, cook until it turns white, if it sticks, you can add a little water.</li>
        <li>When the minced meat is ready, you can add the tomato juice and the drained canned beans and corn. Season with chili, sugar, salt, pepper and Roman cumin to taste. When the sauce has boiled, taste it, then we can flavor it with spices.</li>
        <li>On a slow fire approx. Cook for 60 minutes until the sauce thickens and the amount of tomato juice reduces. Serve with fresh bread.</li>
    </ol>
